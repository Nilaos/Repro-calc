# CHANGES by Nilaos:
# No need to use time.sleep to unnecessarily slow the program down -> No need for
# time import
#
# AVOID single letter variables.
#
# A decimal 1 or 2 without anything else around them is assumed to be an integer,
# unless it has a decimal place, then it's assumed to be a floating-point number.
#
# Bunch of functions added. TODO: Toby - Add more.
# Whitespace added with newlines for readability
# input() messages changed to reduce fluff. TODO: Toby - change the rest


# This is a basic function. It takes no input except on the command line
